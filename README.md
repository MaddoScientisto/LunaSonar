This is an application made to monitor the VRChat API every minute to see if any friends on a list are online and trigger a notification if they are.

I started it as a WPF application but ran into problems with the MVVM library so I switched to a console app and I got my MVP done so I didn't need to develop it further.

I may try to make a blazor desktop MAUI version eventually.
